            <h4 class="featureheading">Spirituality</h4>
            <p id="featuretext"><b>Spirituality</b> means different things to different people. For some, it's primarily
                about
                a belief in God
                and active
                participation in organized religion. For others, it's about non-religious experiences that help them get
                in touch with
                their spiritual selves through quiet reflection, time in nature, private prayer, yoga, or meditation.

                Many people identify as spiritual but not religious: With a few exceptions, the percentage of adults who
                identify as
                religious in many industrialized countries is declining, while remaining generally high in less
                developed nations. Even
                as religious affiliation decreases, though, a sense of spiritual identification could remain steady or
                even increase.

            <h4 id="meditationheading">Meditation</h4>
            <p id="meditationtext">Meditation is a practice that involves focusing or clearing your mind using a
                combination of mental and
                physical
                techniques.
                Depending on the type of meditation you choose, you can meditate to relax, reduce anxiety and stress,
                and more.The practice of meditation is thousands of years old, and different forms come from around the
                world. But modern science
                has only started studying this practice in detail during the last few decades. Some of the biggest leaps
                in science’s
                understanding of meditation have only been possible thanks to modern technology.

            <h4 id="scripturesheading">Scriptures</h4>
            <p id="scripturestext">Hinduism consists of an extensive collection of ancient religious writings and oral
                accounts that
                expound upon eternal truths, some of which Hindus believe to have been divinely revealed and
                realized by their ancient sages and enlightened individuals. Hindu scriptures (such as the Vedas,
                Upanishads, Agamas, and Puranas), epics (the Bhagavad Gita and Ramayana), lawbooks, and other
                philosophical and denominational texts, have been passed on for generations through an oral and
                written tradition.
                Hindu scriptures are classified broadly into two categories: Shruti and
                Smriti. The word Shruti literally means “heard”, and consists of what
                Hindus believe to be eternal truths akin to natural law.

            <h4 id="hinduismheading">Hinduism</h4>
            <p id="hinduismtext">Hinduism, major world religion originating on the Indian subcontinent and comprising
                several and varied systems of
                philosophy, belief, and ritual. Although the name Hinduism is relatively new, having been coined by
                British writers in
                the first decades of the 19th century, it refers to a rich cumulative tradition of texts and practices,
                some of which
                date to the 2nd millennium BCE or possibly earlier. If the Indus valley civilization (3rd–2nd millennium
                BCE) was the
                earliest source of these traditions, as some scholars hold, then Hinduism is the oldest living religion
                on Earth. Its
                many sacred texts in Sanskrit and vernacular languages served as a vehicle for spreading the religion to
                other parts of
                the world, though ritual and the visual and performing arts also played a significant role in its
                transmission.

            <h4 id="mythologyheading">Hindu Mythology</h4>
            <p id="mythologytext">Hindu mythology is populated by an enormous cast of deities, demons, demigods, humans,
                and animals. Some had a central
                role in one era but remain in the background in later periods, while others have risen from obscurity to
                prominence. The
                attributes and histories of many mythological characters have changed considerably over the many
                centuries that Hinduism
                has existed.
